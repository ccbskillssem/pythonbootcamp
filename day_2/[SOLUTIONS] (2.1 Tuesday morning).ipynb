Python starts in the global environment by default.\n","2. Python needs to run a function: in this case, `doggy_daycare()`. This function references several different named variables.\n","3. Python will start by searching the local environment to see if it can find the variable that it needs to execute the function.\n","<br>**If the variable is found, Python goes on and executes the function and we skip Steps 4-6.**\n","\n","4. If this variable is not found, then Python moves up to the next environment.\n","  - If the function happens to be nested inside another function, Python checks the local environment of the enclosing function, called the *enclosed* environment.\n","  - If the function is not enclosed or Python doesn't find what it needs, Python then checks the global environment.\n","5. If Python doesn't find what it needs in the global environment, it does one final check of the *built-in* environment, where all of Python's built in variables and functions exist.\n","6. If Python really doesn't find what you're asking for in any environment, it throws an error.\n","\n","For `doggy_daycare()`, we specifically created variables named `dog_breeds`, `dog_counts`, and `dog_record` inside the function's local environment. Thus, when Python searched for those variables while running `doggy_daycare()`, it found the local variables first, in accordance with the hierarchical search. Since Python found what it needed, it continued on with executing the function.\n","\n","Now, that covers how Python starts from the local environment and progressively searches the outer environments: what about starting from the outer global environment and trying to look into the local?
